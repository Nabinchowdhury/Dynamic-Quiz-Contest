Project name: Dynamic Quiz Contest.

Live Website Link: 

Steps: required for the project-

    • At the very first, I installed all the dependecies such as tailwind, daisyUI, react-router-dom etc.
    • Different components, route paths (static, dynamic) are made for handling the project clearly and to keep code clean.  Also used Context to get data without props drilling.
    • Home contents and Statistics route are showed to the UI by using Context API.
    • HeroIcon, Recharts are used.
    • Conditional rendering and condition css are also used in `/quiz/${id}` route (QuizContest Component).
    • This Project is Responsive with mobile, laptop devices.
